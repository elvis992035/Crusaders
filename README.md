# Crusaders

This game is to present my coding skill. 

Used ArrayList to control the amount of bullets, enemies and the boss. 
Used mutiple classes to create player, bullets, boss and enemies. 
Used inheritance to optimize the code in bullets class and enemy class. 
Used Main class to organize the code which makes it easier to understand and read.
